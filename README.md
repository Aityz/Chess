# Aityz Chess
## Features
Aityz Chess, at it's core is a chess.com API wrapper. The main parts of the program are the analysis and stockfish sub-modules that can be used to analyse games using a custom ``PGNGenerator`` class.
## Documentation
Aityz Chess uses PDoc3 auto generated documentation. It is hosted [here](https://chess.aityz.repl.co).
## Installation
You can install Aityz Chess using Pip! Just type ``pip install aityz_chess`` or ``pip3 install aityz_chess`` depending on your operating system to install!
## Contributing
More analysis functions, and scraping methods would be appreciated, and definitely better documentation and docstrings. I am currently migrating some of the code into sub-modules, and still isn't complete (using right types etc).
